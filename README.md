# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### about this project

My task manager app allows users to efficiently organize their tasks. Users can effortlessly add tasks, each with a title and a due date. The app provides the flexibility to perform actions like deleting, updating, and adding tasks, offering a comprehensive solution for users to effectively manage their task list and stay organized.
